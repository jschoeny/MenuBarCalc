MenuBarCalc is a simple application developed for macOS. It was inspired by the default calculator app's limitation of not being able to be used with fullscreen apps. MenuBarCalc resolves this issue by appearing as a dropdown menu from the macOS Menu Bar whilst keeping the aesthetic of the default macOS calculator app.
